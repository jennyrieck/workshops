# Almost everything you need to know about Partial Least Squares (PLS)
## Jenny Rieck & Derek Beaton 
## Workshop for the Research Training Centre at the Rotman Research Institute
## Fall 2017
  
### Workshop Objectives:

Partial least squares (PLS) is a family of multivariate statistical techniques used extensively in many domains, especially neuroscience and psychology. The PLS workshop is offered in a two-part session. Part 1 covers the theoretical basis of PLS, some of its extensions, related techniques, and inference in PLS (e.g., resampling via bootstrap). We also present small examples in R and will make all material (code, slides, data) available for attendees. Part 2 of this session focuses primarily on how to prepare data and perform PLS with available software (R, Matlab), with an emphasis on larger data sets (e.g., neuroimaging).

Video recordings of each part available upon request (jrieck@research.baycrest.org)
